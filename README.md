# RENTOK Assignment - Final Submission

This is my final submission for the RENTOK Assignment.

## Functionality

1. **Supports Subdomains:**
   - The application implements subdomain routing, allowing for a multi-tenant architecture.

2. **Dynamic Sidebar Color:**
   - The sidebar color changes dynamically based on the subdomain.
   - Hashing is utilized to generate HSL values, resulting in dark and distinct colors for each subdomain.
   - Note: The hashing algorithm used can be further improved and enhanced for better color diversity.

3. **Image Usage:**
   - Music album pictures have been used for demonstration purposes since property pictures were not available at the time of completion.

4. **Background Color Change:**
   - The background color of the app changes based on the color palette of the rent details being viewed.

5. **Properties Screen (Pending):**
   - There is an intention to implement a properties screen, but it could not be completed due to a shortage of time.

## Technologies Used

- **Redux:** Used for state management.
- **Next.js:** Employed for building a React application with server-side rendering.
- **React Palette:** Utilized for color palette generation based on images.
- **SCSS:** Used for styling, enhancing the maintainability and organization of styles.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rentok-assignment.git


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
